## **Improvements in Brazilian Portuguese Speech Emotion Recognition and its extension to Latin Corpora** 

#### This paper analyzed an acted Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) database VERBO, which is available in Brazilian Portuguese. An important aspect in SER modeling is the selection of optimal features to have an unbiased approach towards recognizing emotions while retaining accuracy. This work explores the solely available BP SER database, providing better features to increase the recognition rate for all emotions, and then proposing a simple but robust multi-corporal SER model for EMOVO (Italian), INTER1SP (Spanish), and CaFE (Canadian French). 

#### For all corpora analyzed in this work, an improvement of up to 9% in mean accuracy is achieved and the obtained recognition rate indicates that the proposed feature sets show comparatively less biased behavior towards all emotions. Also, we prescribe a combination of different metrics to be used with two cepstral features to obtain a higher recognition rate. Our proposed state of the art Latin multi-corporal model contains few features, and achieves outperforming results with a classical machine learning classifier, compared to previously exercised complex features, algorithms and architectures, by yielding the best recognition rate.
